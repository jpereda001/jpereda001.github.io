        <h1> My Story</h1>
        <p class="bio">I am an aspiring journalist studying communications at the University of Florida. I know my skill and talents are best suited for this job and ill tell you why: I am able to learn quickly and have a keen interest in gaining knowledge and experience. I have gone abroad to explore new cultures, languages, and lifestyles. What came from that is my ability to adapt quickly to situations. I am also a self-motivated hard worker that doesn’t settle for the expected, but instead strives for the best and I anticipate future possibilities in every situation, which allows me to be organized and planned.</p>

<p class="bio">I also have experience writing new articles for my school newspaper and my previous school’s newspaper. I have a part of multiple clubs such as the ED 2010, society of professional journalists, as well as lead scholars, which is a scholastic leadership organization. I feel my experience as well as my inherent talents will allow me to be a good addition to your organization. For more information, please visit the rest of my portfolio and resume.</p>
